# retro-portfolio-page

Please design a personal programming project portfolio page with an 8-bit retro style. The page should have a nostalgic video game look, using pixel art graphics reminiscent of classic 1980s arcade games. Include sections for different programming projects, each represented by unique 8-bit icons or thumbnails. Use a color palette that reflects the era, such as bright primary colors mixed with darker backgrounds to enhance readability. Ensure the layout is user-friendly, with clear navigation and interactive elements that mimic old-school video game interfaces. The overall design should evoke the charm and simplicity of early video game aesthetics while displaying the projects effectively.
